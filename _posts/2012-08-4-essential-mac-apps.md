So I was thinking about doing a clean install after upgrading to Mountain Lion, I took the opportunity to through my app folder and see what I really needed. In the process I put together this list of essential applications for the Mac.

## The Apps

### Web browsers

**Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera**

Since I do a bit off web developing I need to test my website in all the mayor browsers. Google Chrome is my default browser and I absolutely love the way it syns all my bookmarks etc. over all my devices that run Google Chrome. 

### Mail

I use the default Mail app that comes with Mac OS X. I am not a hardcore email user, so Mail.app does all I need.

### nvALT

I like to take notes, and for that I use nvALT. nvALT is a Notational Velocity fork that adds support for Markdown and other handy stuff. It syncs with Simplenote and Dropbox so I can keep editing my notes while on the go with my iPhone.

### Spotify

I have been a Spotify user for several years, and I'm really happy about it.

### Skype

...


### iTerm

iTerm2 is a replacement for Terminal and the successor to iTerm. It does many things that the default Terminal don't do.

### Sublime Text 2

I have just started using Sublime Text 2 as my default editor instead off TextMate, and I really like it. Coda was my default editor before TextMate.

### MacVim

Although Sublime Text 2 is my default editor, I still like to use vim on a occasion.

### [CodeKit](http://incident57.com/codekit/)

CodeKit helps you build websites faster and better. It process Less, Sass, Stylus, Jade, Haml, CoffeeScript, Javascript and Compass files automatically and instantly reloads your browser. 

If you are a web developer and don't want the hassle with the command line, then you should really get this application.

### Tower

I mostly use git from the command line, but sometimes it is handy to have a GUI to control it from.

### Sequel Pro

....

### Alfred

...

### BetterTouchTool

....

### Hazel

...

### Tweetbot

I absolutely love Tweetbot on iOS, and while Tweetbot for Mac is just in Alpha, it's already my default twitter client. It's currently in version 0.6.3 but has already most off features you would want from a full-featured Twitter client.

### Dropbox

I think everyone knows what Dropbox is, and if you don't, check it out immediately!

### VLC

QuickTime is beautiful, but it dosen't support many file formats. That's where VLC comes in! VLC is an open-source media player that support almost every format you would throw at it.
