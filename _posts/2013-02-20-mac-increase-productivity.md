You probably hear about this or some other application launcher like Launchbar or Quicksilver all the time in this kind of posts. This post is no exception.

Alfred is great. It does not only let you lauch apps, it also let's you  do a bouch of things, like execute a shell command, lookup a contact, email a contact fast, search the web using a bounch of web-searches or creat you own custom web search.

 Only some weeks ago, Alfred 2 beta was released. This update include a new function, "Workflows".
 
 Simply, workflows will let you setup triggers or inputs to execute actions or output stuff. For a idea of what you can do, check out [this blog post](http://blog.alfredapp.com/2012/12/14/v2-sneak-peek-workflows/).

TextExpander is a program that allows you to write out long sentances or repetative text with a few short keystrokes.

For example, you can make ";name" expand into your full name. Or, ";home" into you home address. All this together ca n make a huge time saver.

# [Fantastical](http://flexibits.com/fantastical "Fantastical for Mac | Meet your Mac&#39;s new calendar.")

Fantastical is in my opinion the best calendar application for OS X. It sits in the menu bar and supports natural language entry to add events. Fantastical was also released on iOS some time back.

You can think of Hazel as a maid, Hazel is always there ready and willing to clean up the little messes that appear around your Mac. Hazel watches folders and acts on them based on a series of rules you setup and customize. The best part is Hazel does it all in the background, it need not even be summoned, it just works. 

# [todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/ "Todo.txt CLI") #

Todo.txt is a CLI [^cli] todo manager. It stores your todos in a simple .txt file, that you can store in your Dropbox folder. There are apps for both iOS and Android. I haven't tried the Android app, but the iOS app works great.

[^cli]: Command line.
